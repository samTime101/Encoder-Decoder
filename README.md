# Encoder-Decoder
A simple algorithm and working prototype of encoding a data in a binary table format and decoding it 
suppose we want to save a data eg: suppose a number called 'XYZ' in this table 
the algorithm will convert this data into binary into required minimum bits and convert it to the required grid size

> [!CAUTION]
> This is just a gibbiresh data not an exact representation

This grid is 3x3 and now this is exact representation of number 'XYZ'
now the scanner will have a camera containing an exact 3x3 grid overlay to scan this
